# Statistics_R_work
#### Mixture of University projects in Advanced statistical Modeling and Time Series Modeling

1.  Assignment1_stats330 = [a relative link](Assignment1_stats330_FINISH__5611230_.docx) Advanced statistical models Stats330 - practice of 3 dimensional plotting of categorical variables. Use of mosaic plots, bwplots, trendscatter, residuals plot and cooks distance, basic normchecks. Also basic logestic regression model.

2. Assignment2 stats330 = [a relative link](finals_5611230.docx) Advanced statistical models Stats330 - practice of cooks distance vs leveraged residuals erros in data, pairs plot of looking at auto correlation amoungst the variables, fitting smoothers using mgcv package and gam plots. Fitting simple logistic regression models with non-linear variables

3. Assignment3_stats330 = [a relative link](Assignment3_stats330__5611230_.docx) Advanced statistical models Stats330. Prediction work with general linear models i.e. probability of death vs does type and treatment.

4. Assignment3_stats330 = [a relative link](final_.docx) Advanced statistical models Stats330. Use of stepwise regression to algorithmically find a suitable model and also ROC curves and smoothers to model the probability of good wine or not (categorical prediction)

5. Tutorial 1 [a relative link](tutorial1.docx) Use of different plots to plot 3 dimensional categorical data or 3 dimensional contiunuous variables (3D box plot), also violin plots
